# Introduction

## Material and subjects covered

This tutorial is supplementary material for [Discovering statistics using R](https://studysites.uk.sagepub.com/dsur/main.htm) by Field, A. P., Miles, J., and Field, Z. C. (2012, London: Sage). In this tutorial I provide some interactive exercises and quizzes to learn statistics **and** R. 

I used 'and' instead of 'with' or 'using' as most of the interactive exercises ask to apply R code for a given statistical procedure. So learning R is more prominent as in the mentioned book, whereas the statistical content relies heavily on the explanations given in `Discovering statistics using R` (abbreviated with `DSUR`). To benefit most of this course material you definitively have to buy a copy of DSUR.

## Target group and prerequisite 

This interactive tutorial is primarily intended for people who work through DSUR and want to have more interactive exercises using R. I assume the same level of background knowledge as in DSUR, namely nothing:

"_In essence, I assume you know nothing about statistics, but I do assume you have some very basic grasp of computers … and math._" (DSUR, p.XXV)

## Learning outcomes

The following learning outcomes provide information at the course level. As there are different levels in a curriculum (course, module/chapter lesson/section etc.) with their own learning outcomes only 3-5 learning outcomes on each level is sufficent. In formulating the following outcomes I am applying the taxonomy by Anderson & Krathwohl (2001, 2002) which is an extended and revised edition of the original taxonomy by Bloom (1956).

Having successfully completed this interactive course you will be able to:

+ manipulate and transform data with R to bring them in a format suitable for exploratory data analysis
+ create high quality data visualizations with the R package ggplot2
+ implementing of statistical procedures within the R environment
+ programming an analysis with R in such a way that the script can be used with minimal effort for similar datasets and analyses

## Structure of this tutorial {#structure}

I tried to follow as exactly as possible the structure of DSUR. But sometimes I had to develop other sequeneces. This is esepcially true for the first two chapters as DSUR starts with explaining R in the third chapter. To provide for the R newbies some meaningful exercises even for the first two chapters I had to antedate some content (e.g. how to install R, to explain the elements of the graphical user interface `GUI` etc.

Sometimes I added R related information or even decided to depart from DSUR content. The last is especially true with `RStudio` which installation and GIUs I used instead of the standard R Interface or the program package `R Commander`. But I have noted this differences within a yellow box.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  In yellow boxes I will mention differences to the accompanying source of DSUR.

## Tools used and source code

This interactive course is written in R Markdown and uses the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package in combination with the [`checkr`](https://github.com/dtkaplan/checkr). The source code can be inspected at [my GitHub account](https://github.com/petzi53/DSUR). 

I have written this tutorial to rebuild my own competences in statistics and at the same time to improve my R practice. As I am not an expert on both subject please help to improve this tutorial via PRs or [contact me](mailto:peter_baumgartner@me.com) for errors or other improvements.
